# Bayesian Portfolio Optimizer

A C++ implementation of a **Bayesian Portfolio Optimizer** using the **Normal-Inverse-Wishart (NIW)** prior and **Quadratic Programming** to find the optimal asset weights under uncertainty. This project combines modern Bayesian statistics with mean-variance portfolio theory.

---

## Features

- Bayesian posterior estimation of mean and covariance (NIW conjugate prior)
- Risk-return trade-off optimization using quadratic programming (QP)
- Enforces portfolio constraints:
  - Fully invested: sum of weights = 1
  - No short-selling: weights ≥ 0
- Computes Sharpe ratio, expected return, and volatility
- Efficient and fast (header-only Eigen + QuadProg++)
- **✅ Fully functional and tested**

---

## Current Status: ✅ WORKING

The project has been successfully fixed and is now fully functional. All compilation issues have been resolved, and the optimizer produces valid portfolio weights.

### Recent Fixes Implemented:

1. **✅ Fixed missing data file**: Created `data/returns.csv` with sample data
2. **✅ Fixed CMake configuration**: Corrected paths and Eigen include directories
3. **✅ Fixed Eigen compatibility**: Downloaded and configured Eigen 3.3.9 for better compatibility
4. **✅ Fixed header file issues**: Corrected include paths for QuadProg++ headers
5. **✅ Fixed type conversion issues**: Resolved Eigen type mixing problems
6. **✅ Fixed C++17 compatibility**: Removed structured bindings for better compiler support
7. **✅ Fixed CSV output**: Ensured all weights are properly saved

## Build Instructions

### Windows (MinGW)

1. **Prerequisites**: Install MinGW with g++ compiler

2. **Clone and build**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BayesianPortfolioOptimizer.git
cd BayesianPortfolioOptimizer

# Create build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure with MinGW
cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles"

# Build the project
cmake --build .
```

3. **Run the optimizer**:
```bash
# From the project root directory
cd ..
.\build\optimizer.exe
```

### Linux/macOS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BayesianPortfolioOptimizer.git
cd BayesianPortfolioOptimizer

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

# Run
cd ..
./build/optimizer
```

### Troubleshooting

- **Eigen not found**: The project automatically downloads Eigen 3.3.9 during first build
- **Compiler errors**: Ensure you have a C++17 compatible compiler
- **CMake errors**: Clear build directory and reconfigure: `rm -rf build && mkdir build`

---

## Output Files

- **Console output**: Shows optimization progress and final results
- **weights.csv**: Contains the optimal portfolio weights (one per line)

---

## Theory

We assume:

- Asset returns follow a multivariate normal distribution
- The prior distribution on mean and covariance is Normal-Inverse-Wishart (NIW):

  - μ ~ N(μ₀, Σ / κ₀)  
  - Σ ~ Inverse-Wishart(Ψ₀, ν₀)

After observing the return matrix `R ∈ ℝⁿˣᵈ`, we compute the posterior estimates of mean and covariance:

- μₙ, Σₙ

Then solve the following quadratic optimization problem:

Minimize:

```
(1/2) * wᵗ * Σₙ * w - μₙᵗ * w
```

Subject to:

```
∑ wᵢ = 1
wᵢ ≥ 0
```

This produces an optimal weight vector `w` for portfolio allocation based on the Bayesian estimates.

## Implementation Details

### Bayesian Updates
- **Prior**: μ₀ = 0, κ₀ = 1, Ψ₀ = I, ν₀ = p + 2
- **Posterior**: Computed using NIW conjugate prior updates
- **Optimization**: λ = 1.0 (risk aversion parameter)

### Key Features
- **Type safety**: Explicit type casting to avoid Eigen compatibility issues
- **Error handling**: Robust CSV loading and optimization error checking
- **Debugging**: Comprehensive output showing optimization progress
- **Normalization**: Automatic weight normalization to ensure sum = 1
